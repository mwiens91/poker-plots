# poker-plots

This repo contains the source code for
[this page](https://mwiens91.github.io/poker-plots/). It provides some
nice interactive for poker time-series data. I made a video
demonstrating what features it currently has
[here](https://youtu.be/hBfKXofgwbg).

## Tech

[d3.js](https://d3js.org/) for any of the interactive visualizations;
[pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) for templating; and
some minimal usage of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for
styling.

## How do I use this for myself?

I have some bits in here that are hardcoded to my poker data and hosting
setup, but there aren't too many of these bits. It should be fairly
straightforward to make everything generic in that respect: if you care,
let me know and I'll do make the necessary changes.
